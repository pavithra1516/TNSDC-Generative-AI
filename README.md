          By training a neural network of generators that turns poor-quality images into high-quality ones that closely
          
          resemble real X-ray data GANs serve in chest X-ray enhancement. Patients and physicians alike gain from this
          
          enhanced process, because additionally helps decrease noise, boost diagnostic accuracy, and improve image quality.

          So, GAN is very useful for enhancing the technique in chest x-ray and it is very beneficial.
